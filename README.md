## ✅ Internship Tasks

### 📅 Day 1 — Task 1: Simple Calculator (Java)
**🧾 Description:**  
Developed a console-based calculator capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations.

**Features:**
- Accepts two numbers and an operator as input  
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus  
- Handles invalid operators and division/modulus by zero with error messages  
- Uses functions to modularize operations and a loop for repeated execution until the user exits  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**
- Practiced creating and using Java methods  
- Improved user input handling with Scanner  
- Implemented loops and conditionals for program flow control  
- Strengthened understanding of error handling in arithmetic operations

### 📅 Day 2 — Task 2: Student Record Management System
**🧾 Description:**  
Created a mini Student Management System with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

**Features:**
- Add new student records with unique IDs  
- Display all existing student records  
- Update student details (name, marks, etc.)  
- Delete student records using their ID  
- Handle input errors and duplicate entries gracefully  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**
- Strengthened understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation and class design  
- Implemented ArrayList to manage dynamic collections of students  
- Practiced robust input validation and exception handling with try-catch blocks  
- Built a menu-driven console application with a logical user flow

### 📅 Day 3 — Task 3: Library Management System (Java)
**🧾 Description:**  
Developed a CLI-based Library Management System that allows users to manage books and users efficiently — including adding, issuing, and returning books.

**Features:**
- Add and view books with unique IDs  
- Register and view users  
- Issue books to registered users  
- Return issued books  
- Display books with real-time issued status and borrower information  
- Handle invalid IDs, duplicate entries, and already issued books gracefully  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**
- Applied OOP principles like encapsulation and class interaction  
- Implemented relationships between Book and User classes  
- Practiced dynamic list handling using ArrayList  
- Strengthened logical flow and user interaction in CLI programs  
- Improved exception handling and input validation

### 📅 Day 4 — Task 4: Notes App (Java CLI)
**🧾 Description:**  
Built a command-line Notes App to create, view, and delete text-based notes stored in a file.

**Features:**
- Add, view, and delete notes through a menu-driven interface  
- Store notes persistently using `notes.txt`  
- Numbered listing for easier note management  
- Simple and lightweight file-based storage system  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**
- Implemented file handling using `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, and `BufferedReader`  
- Managed data dynamically with ArrayList for deletion operations  
- Enhanced understanding of exception handling and user input processing  
- Strengthened control flow with loops and conditionals  

---

## 🧩 Future Plans
- Expand existing projects with GUI interfaces (Swing/JavaFX)  
- Explore file-based data persistence (CSV/JSON)  
- Continue improving code documentation and modularity
