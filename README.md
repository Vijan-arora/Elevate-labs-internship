## ✅ Internship Tasks

### 📅 Day 1 — Task 1: Simple Calculator (Java)

**🧾 Description:**  
Developed a console-based calculator capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations.  

**Features:**  
- Accepts two numbers and an operator as input  
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus  
- Handles invalid operators and division/modulus by zero with error messages  
- Uses functions to modularize operations and a loop for repeated execution until the user exits  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**  
- Practiced creating and using Java methods  
- Improved user input handling with `Scanner`  
- Implemented loops and conditionals for program flow control  
- Strengthened understanding of error handling in arithmetic operations

### 📅 Day 2 — Task 2: Student Record Management System

**🧾 Description:**  
Created a mini **Student Management System** with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.  

**Features:**  
- Add new student records with unique IDs  
- Display all existing student records  
- Update student details (name, marks, etc.)  
- Delete student records using their ID  
- Handle input errors and duplicate entries gracefully  

**🧠 Key Learnings:**  
- Strengthened understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation and class design  
- Implemented `ArrayList` to manage dynamic collections of students  
- Practiced robust input validation and exception handling with `try-catch` blocks  
- Built a menu-driven console application with a logical user flow

## 🧩 Future Plans
- Expand existing projects with GUI interfaces (Swing/JavaFX)  
- Explore file-based data persistence (CSV/JSON)  
- Continue improving code documentation and modularity
