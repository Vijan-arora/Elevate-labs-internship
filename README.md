# Elevate-labs-internship
Repository showcasing my internship journey at Elevate Labs â€” including hands-on projects, daily tasks, and practical applications of Java development concepts.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Internship
The Elevate Labs 45-days Internship focuses on hands-on learning through real-world coding challenges, project-based tasks, and guided mentorship.  
Throughout the program, Iâ€™m improving my skills in:
- Core Java Programming  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Recursion and Data Structures  
- File Handling and Exception Handling  
- Building Mini Java Projects  

âœ… Internship Tasks
ðŸ“… Day 1 - Task 1: Simple Calculator using Java

ðŸ§¾ Description:
This task was about building a basic console-based calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations.
Hereâ€™s what the calculator can do:
-Accepts two numbers and an operator as input.
-Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
-Handles invalid operators and division/modulus by zero with error messages.
-Uses functions to modularize operations and a loop for repeated use until the user exits.

ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
-Practiced Java method creation and usage.
-Improved user input handling with Scanner.
-Implemented loops and conditionals for flow control.
-Gained understanding of error handling in arithmetic operations.

ðŸ“… Day 2 - Task 2: Student Record Management System

ðŸ§¾ Description:
This project focused on building a mini student management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.
Key features include:
-Add new student records with unique IDs.
-Display a list of all students.
-Update student details like name and marks.
-Delete student records using their ID.
-Handles input errors and duplicate entries gracefully.

ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
-Deepened understanding of OOP in Java with encapsulation and class structures.
-Implemented ArrayList to manage dynamic collections of students.
-Strengthened input validation and exception handling with try-catch blocks.
-Practiced building menu-driven console applications with logical flow.
